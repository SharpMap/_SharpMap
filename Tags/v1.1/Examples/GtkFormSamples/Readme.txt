This is just a bit of sample code that runs a simple SharpMap application in a GTKSharp and mono environement. 
It should be plateform independent as long as the OS has both GTK# 2.0 and  Mono installed. 

This little sample was build on Ubuntu 11.04 with MonoDevelop 2.4. The nice thing is you can 
use the Static Visual GUI designer using GTK# in MonoDeveop.

Place the states.shp file in the Bin/Debug folder once you have build the application and it should just run.

If you want to run this sample from Visual Studio, you need to install
	http://download.mono-project.com/gtk-sharp/gtk-sharp-2.12.10.win32.msi
and reboot your system.
