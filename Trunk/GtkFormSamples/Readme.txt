This is just a bit of sample code that runs a simple SharpMap application in a GTKSharp and mono environement. It should be plateform independent as long as the OS has both GTK# 2.0 and  Mono installed. This little sample was build on Ubuntu 11.04 with MonoDevelop 2.4. The nice thing is you can use the Static Visual GUI designer using GTK# in MonoDeveop.

Place the states.shp file in the Bin/Debug folder once you have build the application and it should just run.
